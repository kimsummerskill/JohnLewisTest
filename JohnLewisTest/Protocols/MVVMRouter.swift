// Routers are not always nescessary but they can be used to seperate out the presentation logic from the view controllers.
// In this case the router controls where something is presented, what is being presented next based on a decision (user
// presses a button or action that percipitates some form of presentation) and the dismissal of the view controller.

    // The view controller which is used to present the current one
    var baseViewController: UIViewController? { get set }
    
    // This is the entry point for presenting a view controller for a particular router
    func present(on baseViewController: UIViewController, animated: Bool, context: Any?, completion: ((Bool) -> Void)?)
    
    // This method would be used to present a route as the result of some action. For example a new view controller.
    // Context will be used to pass in any information that is required to present the next route. This could
    // be an object or a tuple or anything you really want to pass over or use for instantiation.
