// This class would be used to coordinate various flows in the application. These flows could be anything from popping
// the user out to the app tour when there is an update with new app tour information or back to the login screen if
// their authentication had become invalidated for whatever reason (token expiry etc) or if you had a decision screen flow
// where you might decide what flow to present depending on various conditions (say you had a paired bluetooth device that this
// app was communicating with and it got disconnected and you wanted to show a re-connect flow for example).
