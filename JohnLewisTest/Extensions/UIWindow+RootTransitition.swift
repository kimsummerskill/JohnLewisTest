// This mechanism is not really nescessary for this test, however, I wrote it to show a nice mechanism for
// dealing with switching the root view controller out without a jarring experience. Cases for this would be
// for when you have elements of the application that have decision logic that replaces the root view controller
// based on a decision somewhere.
// For example, app loads, decides to present the 'App tour', 'Login flow' or main user flow. Also for
// logout / pop to decision screens and such. If you simply replace toe root view controller it is quite jarring.

        // If we have a transition, add it to our layer
        if let transition = transition {
            layer.add(transition, forKey: kCATransition)
        }
        
        rootViewController = newRootViewController
        
        // Update status bar appearance using the new view controllers appearance. Animate if required.

        // and presenting a view controller
